### MVP
Fetch ISS location on initial render, then display

Refresh ISS location every ~3-5 seconds while page is active (log to console)

Update overlay icon with new coordinates on location refresh

Add tail which tracks where it has been since page loaded

Add handling for ISS location API being down

Publish to domain

### Nice to have
Support for rendering sunlight
